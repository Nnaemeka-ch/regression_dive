# Feature Selection  

This repository is dedicated to working through different **feature selection techniques** with a focus on both **search-based** and **correlation-based** approaches.  

The intention is to:  
- Explore how each method works in practice.  
- Understand the use cases where one approach may be more effective than the other.  
- Highlight the strengths and limitations of both strategies in real-world scenarios.  

## Approaches Covered  
- **Search-based feature selection**  
  - Uses systematic strategies (forward selection, backward elimination, exhaustive search, etc.) to explore possible subsets of features.  
  - Typically involves evaluating subsets using a criterion or a model.  

- **Correlation-based feature selection**  
  - Relies on statistical relationships between features and the target variable.  
  - Provides fast, interpretable insights without requiring repeated model training.  

## Goal  
By working through both categories, this project aims to build a deeper understanding of when and why to use a particular feature selection technique, and the trade-offs involved.
